## What is Dutty's Den?

Dutty's den is a webapp that I created to solve the problem of keeping track of my poker groups weekly games. The reason I had to write this webapp was because
the score tracking system built into Pokerstars was broken at the time. I wrote this mainly as an excuse to teach myself web development, before this webpage we 
just used a google sheet to keep score.

## What is it written in?

Dutty's den was written to be a NodeJs application. It consists of a expressJs backend with a React frontend.
